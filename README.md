# Interactive Rating Component

A repository that holds my first simple and basic web development project that is to create an interactive rating card and a 'Thank You' card. The aim of this project was to consolidate and solidify some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript principles. It provided practice on handling user interactions in the form of buttons and being able to update the DOM.
